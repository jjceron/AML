# Advanced Machine Learning (AML)

This repository collects experiments, code, and materials developed while following the **Advanced Machine Learning** course. It explores both classical and modern approaches in machine learning, with emphasis on probabilistic modeling, generative methods, and sequential data analysis.  

## Course Objectives

- Apply classical and probabilistic unsupervised learning techniques to identify latent structures in data.  
- Design and implement generative and Bayesian models, including GANs, VAEs, diffusion models, and probabilistic neural networks.  
- Formulate and train weakly supervised models based on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), covering theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and applications in domains with limited labels.  
- Model sequential data through classical approaches (ARIMA, HMM) and modern probabilistic deep learning methods.
